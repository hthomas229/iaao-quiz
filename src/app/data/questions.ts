        "question": "The electrical outlets in the kitchen of a single-family residence are inadequate. The cost of the existing outlets is $3,600. The depreciation of the outlets is 50 percent. The cost to remove the old outlets and install adequate outlets is $4,600. There is not any salvage value in the old outlets. If adequate outlets had been installed originally, it would have cost $3,800. By installing adequate outlets, the increase in market value of the property will more than offset the cost of the new outlets. What is the amount of depreciation attributable to the electrical outlets in the kitchen?",
